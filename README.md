# coral_deoxygenation_RNASeq

Project Summary
We experimentally exposed two common reef-building corals, Acropora tenuis and Acropora selago, to 12 h continuous deoxygenation (<2 mg O2 L-1) followed by 12 h re-oxygenation (~6 mg O2 L-1) via their natural night-day light cycle and followed gene expression changes.
